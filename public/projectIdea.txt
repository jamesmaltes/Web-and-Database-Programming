For my project in Web and Database Programming, I want to make a website based on the sci-fi principle of cryonics,
or the freezing of people after their death in the hopes that they can be revived sometime in the future.  This website 
will allow people to sign up for an account and reserve a spot so that they can be frozen at the time of their death.  
The database will keep track of people's information and the amount of available spots, as well as possibly allowing 
for public donations to the company.
